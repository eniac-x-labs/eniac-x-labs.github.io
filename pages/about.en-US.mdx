# Introduction to Savour Dao

The reason why we propose the Savour project is twofold. First, we are particularly excited about the future of the entire blockchain world. Second, we want to make some contributions to the development of this industry. Of course, the most important reason is that we want to create our own Web3 world and contribute to the development of the entire industry.

So what will Savour Dao do? We will create a decentralized platform that includes a NFT aggregator, social recovery wallet, gameFi, decentralized finance, and other Dapp services. For more details, you can refer to our project design document.
