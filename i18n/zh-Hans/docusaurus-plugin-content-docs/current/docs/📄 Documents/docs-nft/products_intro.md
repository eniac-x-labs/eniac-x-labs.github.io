# Products Introduction

We aim to create a decentralized wallet platform that encompasses diverse NFT functionalities. 

The wallet component will include an HD wallet, social recovery wallet, and MPC wallet. The varied NFT functionalities comprise NFT creation, IP sales, component assembly and sales, NFT trading (including NFT pledging), NFT leasing, blue-chip NFT endorsements, NFT collateralized lending, NFT latest project analysis and recommendations, tracking services for NFT whales, and NFT games. 

The content of NFTs encompasses collectibles and avatars, as well as socially-inclined NFTs. Additionally, on top of these comprehensive features, weâ€™ve categorized users based on their NFT preferences, providing them with their exclusive NFT playground. In the initial phase, our focus will primarily be on wallets and NFTs. In the future, our product will shift its focus towards privacy-centric social interactions and the development of Layer 3 applications.
